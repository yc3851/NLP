Homework number: 1
Instruction: feature.py is used to extract data. It is imported in hw1.py
             hw1.py can be fun with following command:
             python3 hw1.py --train <path_to_resources>/data/train.csv
                            --test <path_to_resources >/data/dev.csv
                            --model choices from ["Ngram", "Ngram+Lex", "Ngram+Lex+Enc", "Custom"]
                            --lexicon_path <path_to_resources >/lexica/
             It would print out the class wise f1 and macro f1 score for the model

             The extra feature used in Custom model is the number of occurrences of pos tag
